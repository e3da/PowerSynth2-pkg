This is a half-bridge SiC module.
Since only bonding wires are used for both gate and power loop connections, this is a wire-bonded module.
Since multiple device layers are stacked vertically, it is a 3D module.
Single through cermaic via connected DBC is used to reduce parasitics. Embedded cooling is possible to have better thermal management. However, in this case, the heat transfer coefficient is considered for forced air cooling.
Kelvin source connection is present.
This case is used in TPEL 2022:
