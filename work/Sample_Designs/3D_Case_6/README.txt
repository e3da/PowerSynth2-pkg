This is a half-bridge SiC module.
Since only bonding wires are used for both gate and power loop connections, this is a wire-bonded module.
Since multiple device layers are stacked vertically, it is a 3D module.
Two DBCs are connected face-to-face using metallic post-type via connector for double-sided cooling.
Kelvin source connection is present.
This case is used in DMC 2021:
